          <p className="mb-4">
            Before the colonial ships docked on our shores, before the foreign flags were raised over our sacred soil, 
            we were an interconnected tapestry of vibrant communities, powerful kingdoms, and harmonious societies. 
            Cameroon was not defined by languages forced upon us by colonial invaders; we were defined by kinship, 
            ancestral bonds, shared traditions, and collective spirituality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our ancestors thrived across the diverse landscapes of Cameroon, united by customs, beliefs, foods, 
            dances, and rituals passed down through generations.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Our Ancestral Roots: United Beyond Borders" icon="üåç">
          <p className="mb-4">
            The Tikar people of the Northwest and the Bamileke of the West Region share direct ancestral connections, 
            evident in cultural similarities, traditional attire, language roots, and social structures. Bamenda and 
            Bafoussam are not divided by any true cultural boundary; they share heritage and ancestral lineage, from 
            communal systems of governance to sacred rituals and symbolic artistry.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The Douala of the Littoral Region and the Bakweri of the Southwest have historically intermarried, traded, 
            and shared cultural festivities like the Ngondo festival, demonstrating deeply intertwined histories and 
            traditions. From the coastlines of Limbe to the banks of the Wouri River, our shared fishing traditions, 
            canoe-making skills, and maritime festivals have always brought us together.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Fulani and Hausa peoples in the Northern regions have long-standing historical alliances and exchanges 
            with the peoples of the Southern forest regions and Eastern plains. We have always exchanged goods, traditions, 
            and ideas through ancient trade routes that predate any colonial demarcation.

        <Section title="The Colonial Agenda: Dividing the Indivisible" icon="‚öîÔ∏è">
          <p className="mb-4">
            Colonial powers arrived, bringing a narrative of division intended to weaken and dominate us. They imposed 
            artificial languages‚ÄîFrench and English‚Äîlabels of "Anglophone" and "Francophone," designed not for our 
            identity but for their convenience and control.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            These invaders disrespected our forefathers, desecrated our sacred groves, humiliated our elders publicly, 
            mocked our spiritual systems, and systematically stole our resources. They enslaved our people, exploiting 
            our labor and strength to build their empires, while simultaneously undermining our indigenous civilizations 
            and cultural pride.
          </p>
          <p>
            They desecrated the shrines of the Bamoun Kingdom. They outlawed the secret societies of the Bakossi and Ekoi. 
            They burned the totems of the Tikar and rewrote our oral histories. Their aim was not just to rule us‚Äîit was 
            to <strong>erase us</strong>.

        <Section title="Resistance and Sacrifice: Cameroon's Martyrs and Heroes" icon="üî•">
          <p className="mb-4">Our forefathers and foremothers resisted fiercely:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Ruben Um Nyob√©</strong>, assassinated for advocating unity and freedom.</li>
            <li><strong>F√©lix-Roland Moumi√©</strong>, poisoned abroad for refusing to surrender Cameroon's sovereignty.</li>
            <li><strong>Ernest Ouandi√©</strong>, executed publicly, yet his spirit demanded unity until his last breath.</li>
            <li><strong>Martin-Paul Samba</strong>, killed for fighting colonial injustice.</li>
            <li><strong>Ndeh Ntumazah</strong>, <strong>Albert Mukong</strong>, <strong>Osende Afana</strong>, and countless others suffered imprisonment, exile, torture, and death, all insisting Cameroon remain one, united, and indivisible.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These were not "Francophones" or "Anglophones." They were <strong>Cameroonians</strong>‚Äîguardians of the soul of the land.

        <Section title="Cameroonians Shining Globally" icon="üåü">
          <p className="mb-4">
            Our unity has always been our greatest strength. From business and innovation to entertainment and politics, 
            Cameroonians have shown that united we thrive:

            <li><strong>Charlotte Dipanda</strong>, <strong>Stanley Enow</strong>, <strong>Richard Bona</strong>, and <strong>Manu Dibango</strong>, whose music transcends borders.</li>
            <li>Entrepreneurs like <strong>Kate Fotso</strong> and <strong>Baba Danpullo</strong>, who build economic bridges across regions.</li>
            <li>Politicians and statesmen such as <strong>John Ngu Foncha</strong>, <strong>Ahmadou Ahidjo</strong>, <strong>Paul Biya</strong>, <strong>Simon Achidi Achu</strong>, whose leadership spanned regions, languages, and cultural backgrounds.</li>

        <Section title="The Pain of Division: A Colonial Legacy" icon="üíî">
          <p className="mb-4">
            Today's conflict, driven by the imported and imposed narrative of "Anglophone" versus "Francophone," has cost 
            thousands of innocent lives and devastated families across our country. This division serves the agenda of those 
            who once oppressed and exploited us, weakening our collective power.

          <p className="mb-4">
            But remember: We were never born divided.<br />
            We were made to believe we are.
          </p>
          <p>
            We must reject these colonial labels. We must reject any narrative that divides brother from brother, 
            sister from sister.

          <p>
            For eternity, our children and their children will meet, marry, and share meals together. We must ensure they
